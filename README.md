# APPM
Oracle Database Performance Monitoring Tool

APPM collects, analyzes and displays historical and current performance statistics of an Oracle Database. It collects performance data such as wait events and active session history. Collected data is stored in central repository and is used to identify and analyze performance issues like, for example, identifying a resource intensive SQL statement.

There are two editions, a free Free Edition and commercial offering known as a Enterprise Edition.

Highlights:

* **Central Repository**  
  *Compare performance statistics between different environments and time frames.*
  
* **Graphical frontend for variety of performance related tools**  
  *Such as sql tracing, sql patching, statspack, etc...*

* **Minimal production footprint**  
  *No data is stored on production database.*

* **Oracle Standard Edition compatibility**  
  *Provides alternative for ASH & AWR functionality which is only available in Enterprise Edition*
